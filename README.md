## NextJS SSR E-commerce Site

Basic e-commerce frontend built with NextJS and Typescript, designed for server side rendering.

## Features

- Browse products (Paginated)
- View product page, select quantity and add to basket
- View basket, delete items and change quantity
- See quantity in header

## Assumptions

- Server side rendering is needed for SEO purposes, hence I'm using NextJS inbuilt functions
  because useEffects are for client side only
- Mobile friendly because most users browse on mobile
- Other CSS tools are allowed such as Styled-components. If I had more time I would've used Tailwind.
